# RBE 550 - Advanced Search Algorithms

## Overview

In this assignment, you are required to program one advanced discrete planning algorithm and one advanced sampling-based algorithm. Please choose from the following list:

**Advanced discrete planning (2pts):**
  - WA
  - ARA*
  - ANA*

**Advanced sampling-based planning (2pts):**
  - PRM with adaptive sampling
  - RRG
  - Informed RRT*


You could also choose other advanced algorithms from other papers. Please refer to these papers in the report if so.

You could use the previous templates or assignments to start with. After implementing your code, you are required to make a comparison between the more advanced algorithms and the previous ones. Please submit the code and a report (1pts), in which you should briefly explain the algorithm and discuss its advantages with the help of your comparison results.

Please submit your work as a .zip file.
